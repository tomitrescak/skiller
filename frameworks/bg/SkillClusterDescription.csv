These engineers usually develop APIs using a technology called REST. REST is an acronym for 'representational state technology.' Applications created using this technology are referred to as RESTful APIs. API engineers use RESTful APIs to create any number of individual applications and products for an organization. API engineers code in a number of different computer languages that are portable or non-platform dependent, such as Java, Ruby, Scala, JavaScript, as well as hypertext protocol markup language (HTML) for web pages. An API engineer will write code and incorporate existing APIs into that code, or the engineer may write an original API specific to the organization's needs.
",203,BestAccreditedColleges
27,https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/api-development-skills,"To develop code and arrange programs, developers use multiple skills they've learned through training and experience. Application programming interface (API) development skills are essential in app development across multiple devices, databases and servers. Understanding what skills are necessary for API design can help you grow as a web developer. In this article, we discuss the importance of developing API skills and explore a list of important skills for API development.


API development skills are important because they allow software developers to connect and integrate a variety of programs and systems. In other words, API programming is the gateway intermediary that allows different apps, programs, browsers and extensions to communicate and work together to accomplish different feature goals. For example, a program extension and a browser can work together through API connections to give a user extended features while on the internet, such as translating languages or implementing visual changes, such as a dark mode. Modern programming uses extensive API connections to improve connectivity across different devices, apps and programs.


Some API development skills that can be useful for many roles in the web development industry include:

1. API design

Understanding how to design API connections between multiple devices can help develop API skills. Both mobile and desktop application developers can benefit from learning API design techniques for each system in order to expand their skills and diversify their capabilities. With API design skills, developers can create interconnected tools, applications and micro-servers across multiple platforms for increased interaction and connectivity.
For example, a software developer can use API design to translate and connect mobile phone operating systems to the media software in vehicles. This can allow users to make calls, answer text messages and change music choices safely while traveling.
Related: Common REST API Interview Questions (And Example Answers)

2. Cross-platform development

Cross-platform development for applications allows developers to use a single code base across multiple product uses. For example, a cross-platform video game, when developed properly, can sell on multiple platforms without needing extra coding work. Organizations invest in cross-platform capabilities for their applications to reach diverse customer platforms while fulfilling sufficient demand. To help companies achieve these goals, web developers who understand API development can learn to create efficient API programs.
3. Multiple coding languages
Operators can develop programs within technology like the cloud by using programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and Node.js. It's important for a developer to work in the language best-suited for the goals of their current project. By having a wide knowledge of languages, they can be sure to know how to program in the most effective one.
Understanding multiple programming languages can also train developers to program for diverse technological needs and customer demands. If a programmer understands different programming languages, they may develop the API skills necessary to build different storage services, automation tools and security features for a server or database.

4. Front-end development

While not all front-end development features API development, understanding how to create an application from the beginning may aid comprehension of API development principles. Many programming standards in modern industries focus on product compatibility during front-end development. Programmers with experience in front-end development may develop their API programming skills more quickly by learning the basic needs of program compatibility.
For example, designing a program for mobile and desktop devices may not require full API compatibility. However, learning to develop software compatibility can help programmers quickly learn the skills necessary for future API developments.

5. API orchestration

Effective API programs create more than cross-platform experiences. They also work with other API programs in an API orchestration process. Programmers who understand API orchestration can develop multiple API code lines at once and make them work together. They can also create API code that works well with other, previously existing lines of API code. Because API orchestration allows developers to create easily adjustable code, recruiters for programming positions may consider API orchestration a valuable addition to a resume.

6. Integration knowledge

Service-oriented architecture (SOA), or integration, can help API developers provide server compatibility with multiple programs and services. Organizations with API specialists who understand integration and differing technology requirements can help develop back-end systems for multiple clients with diversified needs. By understanding integration, programmers can further understand API development and the needs it can fulfill.
Creating API systems helps organizations manage and transfer data through multiple systems and servers. For example, if a company has an API expert who understands integration, they might create a server that manages multiple platforms across different countries, fulfilling needs such as censoring data for country law restrictions or upholding data transfer speed standards.

7. Tool proficiency
There are many tools that can help web developers increase their proficiency in API development. Program editors, database managers and testing tools can help programmers begin large-scale projects and thoroughly test compatibility possibilities. Some of these tools include:
Makefile: Makefile is a JavaScript editing program that allows programmers to manage directories. Programmers use Makefile to change directory contents and change macro values in order to ensure compatibility and software functionality.
JUnit: JUnit is a JavaScript library for testing code. Programmers use JUnit to test software compatibility for databases in an offline setting before establishing program code in online servers.
J2EE: J2EE is an extension or plug-in testing tool. Programmers use J2EE to test the compatibility of applications while using different extensions, such as browsers.
TortoiseSVN: TortoiseSVN is a Windows testing tool that helps programmers test products throughout the various stages of development. Programmers can use it to compare different product versions to each other, solve regression issues and make progress in software projects.
MySQL: MySQL is a database adjustment tool programmers use to configure servers, test compatibility and backup database data.
Tomcat 7: Tomcat 7 is a Java-based tool that can help programmers edit various JavaScript applications. It helps programmers compare different JavaScript applications, their compatibility and how they work with other pre-built JavaScript codes.
Apache JMeter: Apache JMeter allows programmers to test software, regardless of base code. It can process many programming languages and test behavior outputs and performance limits.
REST: REST is a programming tool that encourages programmers to test architectural style and compatibility with existing web-based services. Programmers can use this tool to test their applications with existing websites in order to document API behavior.
JSON: JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, allows programmers to transfer data from one application to another. They can use this tool to test API compatibility between websites.
XML: XML editing tools allow programmers to test and develop XML programs. Because many programs may use XML, understanding XML tools and XML itself can help programmers further test compatibility between different programs and develop API skills.
PHP: Programmers use PHP to manage dynamic content, track programming sessions, configure databases and build websites. They can use PHP editing tools with MySQL to test database compatibility and build API skills.
Symfony2: A more streamlined version of PHP, Symfony2 focuses on program architecture and helps programmers update program frameworks. Programmers use Symfony2 to build web applications and test compatibility with existing applications and other websites.
Yii: Yii is a PHP editing tool that allows software developers to build large-scale web applications. Programmers use Yii to test and develop programs efficiently in the front-end building process.",300,Indeed

36,https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/memo-writing-guide,"A memo, or memorandum, is a written document businesses use to communicate an announcement or notification. While memos were once the primary form of written internal communication in a business, they are now commonly sent in the form of an email.

What is a memo?
A memo is a short message that's typically used to communicate official business policies and procedures within a company. Memos are usually meant as a mass communication to all members of an organization rather than a one-on-one personal message. There are many types of memos, but they typically provide a progress report, asking someone or a team for something, confirm an agreement between parties) or request input on how to solve a problem.

When you should write a memo
For the most part, the purpose of writing a memo is to inform. However, memos can occasionally include a call to action or a persuasive element.
Here are some instances when a memo might be useful:
Informing employees about company policy or process changes
Providing an update on key projects or goals
Making an announcement about the company, such as an employee promotion or new hire
Reminding employees about a task that needs to be completed
Making a request of all employees
Communicating a message that employees will refer to more than once, such as a detailed proposal or recommendation
Memos are also an efficient way to communicate brief but important messages to a wide audience within the business. This can include product changes, meeting schedules, procedure changes, policy additions, summaries of agreement terms and reminders. Additionally, you can send a memo when you want your audience to print or save the information contained in the message in some way for later reference.",428,Indeed

39,https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/phone-skills-resume,"What are phone skills?
Phone skills include effective communication, interpersonal skills and the ability to incorporate appropriate phone etiquette. Successful phone conversations (such as converting leads to paying customers) can depend on how well you apply your conversational techniques, how clearly you speak and how you approach engaging people you speak with. Because phone conversations can be a part of nearly any business operation, it can be important to develop these skills to showcase your expertise on your resume, during interviews and in the workplace.

One of the most important aspects of demonstrating effective phone skills is the ability to communicate effectively and efficiently. Whether you work in customer service or a leadership role, effectively communicating by phone can encompass active listening, eliciting conversation with callers to help solve problems and finding ways to understand the needs of others.

Along with the ability to communicate effectively, phone skills can also depend on your interpersonal skills. Being able to read a caller's tone of voice, interpret their emotions and adapt your tone and conversational style to the discussion can be a crucial part of effective phone skills.

Making and receiving calls in the workplace may also depend on organizational skills. Taking notes, relaying messages and gathering and sorting customer information can be a big part of what it means to be successful in demonstrating your ability to handle large call volumes.

Oftentimes, organizations like call centers and customer service centers may integrate computer software that automates calling features such as sorting current phone numbers, organizing cold leads from warm leads and recording calls. Phone skills can include these types of technical skills, as well as your ability to learn how to navigate call automation software.

Speaking with customers on the phone can also mean applying attention to detail. The ability to manage multiple phone calls and keep inbound and outbound phone logs organized is essential for any job that requires phone skills. Managing call lists, removing derelict phone numbers and documenting call information can depend on your attention to detail.

No matter who you speak with during a phone call, you can expect to rely on your customer service skills. Using a friendly tone, asking the caller questions that help to identify problems or specific needs and maintaining professional conduct are aspects of quality customer service that can impact how effectively you connect with people over the phone.

54,https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/mathematical-modeling,"Mathematical modeling is a process that uses math concepts to explain systems, functions and events. Nearly any industry can benefit from mathematical modeling, but it's most commonly used in areas such as engineering, computer science, social science and natural science. Depending on your career and job responsibilities, you might need to use this technique to solve problems, explain why things happen and make predictions. In this article, we explain the benefits and uses of mathematical modeling and provide a few examples you can use to understand how it works.

What is mathematical modeling?
Mathematical modeling is a method that represents and explains real systems and occurrences using math formulas, descriptions and approaches. Professionals use mathematical models to examine, analyze and predict behavior and events. They also use it to solve complex problems and answer questions. A mathematical model follows these basic steps:
Define the problem.
Make an assumption.
Define the variables you want to use in your model.
Calculate a solution.
Analyze and assess the model and its results to validate its accuracy.
Report the results to your team, client or audience.
The more complex the problem, the more variables, assumptions and iterations you might need to make. Extremely complex mathematical models are typically input into computer programs to create computer models. Examples of math-based computer modeling include economic models and weather predictions.

Mathematical models can be classified in a variety of ways, depending on their structure, including:
Linear: The relationship between all variables in a model is linear, or straightforward and sequential.
Nonlinear: The relationship between all variables in a model is not linear.
Static: The model does not consider time.
Dynamic: The model does consider changes over time.
Deterministic: A model with known variables.
Stochastic: A model with unknown variables.
Deductive: The model is based on theory.
Inductive: The model is based on observation or experience.
Floating: The model is neither deductive nor inductive.
Mathematical modeling demonstrates the importance of math to answer questions and solve problems.

Uses for mathematical modeling
While the engineering, computer and science fields use mathematical modeling the most, you can use it to make decisions and predictions about nearly anything. Ways to use mathematical modeling include:
Timing traffic lights
Controlling disease spread
Managing resources
Testing how certain changes might affect a system
Making strategic management or planning decisions
Modeling and reconstructing remains and artifacts
Explaining concepts such as the origin of the universe
Making animal and plant breeding decisions based on genetics

Knowledge of Building Laws and Codes
Zoning laws and building codes dictate much about what can be built, where, and how. Some of these regulations pertain directly to the architect’s work, such as the number and size of windows for various building types. Some laws prohibit building on certain sites, like in wetlands or flood zones. Some regulations do not directly involve the architect, but all your work will be for nothing if you can’t understand how zoning and building codes work in the area of construction.

Technically, graphic design is visual communication. Graphic design incorporates creative and functional understanding of seven elements into its own form of communication: space, texture, color, line, size, form, and shape.

71,https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-skills-do-graphic-designers-need,"Graphic Designers bring together art and technology, so they need a knowledge of design principles combined with a mastery of design software. Because they often work with clients and colleagues on various projects, they also need important soft skills like communication and problem solving.

Technical Skills

Design principles
A strong understanding of design principles is essential for any Graphic Designer. Throughout their work, they will strategically use different elements to convey intended messages. Graphic Designers need to know how to bring together lines, color, shape, space, texture, typography, scale, dominance and emphasis, and harmony to create visually appealing and well-structured designs.

Ideation
Also known as idea generation, ideation is the creative process of generating, developing and communicating new ideas. This is the first thing that a Graphic Designer will need to do when beginning a new project. Ideation involves a few steps: research, development, evaluation, and application.

There are many techniques and skills that Graphic Designers use for the ideation process. Two examples are mood boards and thumbnails. Mood boards are a collection of visuals used to explore new ideas and communicate the tone or direction of a project. Thumbnails are quick, rough sketches that approximate the layout of a design, including key elements like images, headlines, and copy.

Branding
Graphic Designers often build or maintain branding for their client or employer. When working with a brand, they need an in-depth understanding of what makes that brand unique. Then, they need to bring that brand to life through logos, colors, typography, illustration, photography, graphic elements, and more. Graphic Designers should be able to create work that is consistent across platforms and that speaks to the right audience.

Typography
Typography is one of the most important elements of graphic design. The right typography can create meaning and invoke feeling, while the wrong typography can be distracting or repel customers. Graphic Designers need to be skilled in everything from selecting the right font for a project to typesetting, kerning, tracking, and leading.

Designing for print
While digital design is rapidly growing, designing for print is still a useful skill to know. Graphic Designers should be familiar with bleeds, slug, crop, and fold marks, as well as with ink limits, dot gains, and transparency. They also need a thorough understanding of different file formats and color systems, as well as paper sizes, weights, and stocks.

UX and UI design
UX and UI skills can help Graphic Designers improve their work and stay competitive in the field. By understanding UX and UI, Graphic Designers can create designs that are both visually appealing and functional. Graphic Designers may sometimes work closely with UX and UI Designers, so understanding the fundamentals will allow them to better collaborate and communicate with team members.

Technology
Graphic Designers work with a variety of tools as part of their day-to-day, so they will need to master certain graphic design software. Some of the technology that Graphic Designers should be familiar with include: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, and Sketch. Graphic Designers who design for the web would also benefit from learning to code and knowing programming languages, such as HTML and CSS, as well as content management systems like WordPress.

Soft Skills for Graphic Designers

Creativity
Graphic Designers are constantly tasked with developing new and unique ideas. The designs they create need to capture people’s attention while also communicating an intended message, which requires a lot of creative thinking.

Communication
Graphic design is visual communication, so communication skills are at the heart of a Graphic Designer’s work. Not only do they need to communicate ideas through their designs, but Graphic Designers also need to communicate with colleagues and clients. At times, designers may need to explain a design decision or rationale to people without a design background. In addition, they will need both written and verbal communication skills for proposals and presentations.

Strategy
Graphic Designers are strategic thinkers – they have to consider how certain design elements work together and how to best convey meaning while adhering to design standards. This involves conducting market research, brainstorming, thumbnailing, developing ideas, and evaluating designs.

Problem solving
Think of a design brief as a problem: a client needs something to be communicated, and the right design will solve their problem. Graphic Designers use problem solving skills throughout the design process. This may involve troubleshooting design issues or revising designs to meet client needs.

Time management
Graphic Designers often work on multiple projects at once, and may be dealing with deadlines from several different clients. Graphic Designers need to be able to balance workloads and prioritize projects.
Can I Be a Graphic Designer If I Can’t Draw?
Drawing skills are not required for the majority of graphic design jobs. Most of the time, Graphic Designers use design software, so mastering the software is more important than improving your drawing skills.

While you can certainly plan out concepts through drawings, it is not essential. Some Designers use simple sketches as a first step in their design process, but you opt to create mockups in design software instead. In most cases, the final design product will not involve any drawing.",168,BrainStation

79,https://newschoolarch.edu/blog/how-to-become-a-green-architect/,"What is Green Architecture?

When considering a career as a green architect, it is important to understand what green architecture is. Green architecture is a building that helps reduce the negative and harmful effects on our climate and natural environment all through its design strategy, construction process, and operation. The designer’s job is to ensure safeguard air, water, and earth by choosing eco-friendly/sustainable materials and protecting the biodiversity of the area during construction practices. The green building design may include solar panels, commercial toilet composting, or rainwater harvesting. Not all green buildings are the same nor do they need to be the same. Factors like country, region, climate conditions, cultural traditions, or regulations will influence the sustainable design. Overall, these infrastructures help reduce their environmental footprint and are more environmentally friendly.

Identifying the Characteristics of Green Architecture

In order to attain this lofty objective, a green architect must have an in-depth understanding of sustainable building materials and green construction methodologies. This may entail a host of unique approaches, such as;

Utilizing non-toxic and biodegradable resources
Ecologically-savvy plumbing fixtures and rainwater methods for water conservation
Efficient heating and cooling using natural ventilation systems
Designs for energy efficiency, such as lighting, appliances, solar panels, or wind power
Green waste management using salvaged and recycled materials
Native vegetation for landscaping with minimal environmental impact to natural surroundings
Other forms of self-sustainable engineering
Keeping these factors in mind, individuals with a penchant for the creative arts, excellent analytical skills, and a passion for protecting the environment may find this a challenging and rewarding occupation worth pursuing.

Knowing What is LEED

LEED is an important acronym to familiarize yourself with. It stands for “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.” It is a third-party green building program and is the most widely used green building rating system in the world.

116,https://www.brianmac.co.uk/coachsr.htm,"Coach/Athlete Training Roles

The roles of the coach and athlete in determining training requirements will change over the time an athlete is with a coach.

When an athlete first starts in a sport/event (cognitive stage), the coach's role is to direct the athlete in all aspects of training (telling or showing coaching style).
As the athlete develops and demonstrates a sound technical understanding (associative stage) of the sport/event then gradually the coach's role changes to one where the coach and athlete discuss and agree on appropriate training requirements (involving coaching style).
As the athlete matures and demonstrates a sound understanding of training principals (autonomous stage), then the athlete will determine the training requirements. The coach's role becomes one of a mentor providing advice and support as and when required.

Coaching skills

As a coach, you will initially need to develop the skills of organising, safety, building rapport, providing instruction and explanation, demonstrating, observing, analysing, questioning and giving feedback.

Organising

In organising the training session, you need to plan how you will manage the athletes, equipment and area - group athletes accordingly to numbers, ability and the activity - continually check the plan is safe during the session.

Safety

In providing a safe environment for the athletes you must assess the risk of the area, equipment and athletes - continue to assess risk throughout the session - keep athletes on the set task and follow correct practice and progressions.

Building Rapport

In building rapport with the athletes learn and use their names, smile and make eye contact, coach the athlete rather than the sport, show interest in and respect for the athletes.

Instruction and explanation

In providing Instruction and Explanation, you should think about and plan what you are going to say, gain the athlete's attention, ensure they can all hear you, keep it simple and to the point and check they understand by asking open questions.

Demonstration

In providing demonstration make sure you are in a position where the athletes can clearly see and hear you, identify 1 or 2 key points for the athletes to focus on, repeat the demonstration in silence 2 or 3 times (side, back and front view), ask if they have any questions and check they understand by asking open questions. There are times when it might be more appropriate to use someone else to provide the demonstration.

Observation and Analysis

In observing and analysing break the action down into phases, focus on one phase at a time, observe the action several times from various angles & distances, compare the action with your technical model and if appropriate determine what corrective action is required. Remember your ears can also be used to observe - e.g. listen to the rhythm of the feet of the hurdler.

Feedback

In providing feedback encourage the athlete to self analyse by asking appropriate open questions, provide specific and straightforward advice, limit the information to 1 or 2 points, check they understand what they will do next and make the whole process a positive experience for the athlete.",433,BrianMac Sports Coach

Aerospace engineering focuses on the design of vehicles designed to operate within the earth’s atmosphere and vehicles intended for use in space (e.g. aeroplanes, helicopters, drones, missiles, satellites, space stations and spacecraft).

What does an aerospace engineer do?

Aerospace engineers are involved in every phase of the design and construction of aircraft and spacecraft and possess a broad knowledge of all of the various aspects of this process, including structural mechanics, aerodynamics, propulsion systems and the onboard electronic systems used for flight guidance and control.

Typical tasks performed by an aerospace engineer include producing designs using technical drawing applications such as CAD, carrying out technical and financial feasibility studies and running simulations to verify the constructability and viability of projects. They may also build prototypes, which are tested so that any faults or defects can be identified and corrected, and collect data to verify the prototype’s compliance with the applicable technical requirements and standards (in a phase known as verification and validation).

During the production phase, aerospace engineers are responsible for overseeing construction work and coordinating other related activities, including final testing.

Circuit designers have the responsibility of designing electronic circuits that make up electrical systems. Other responsibilities circuit designers have include designing different types of circuits and boards and creating signal processing filters.

Circuit Designer Job Description

While other types of engineers design electronic products, circuit designers work on a smaller scale and design the circuits that serve as the foundation for these products. They may modify existing designs or create new designs. Because circuit technology is constantly changing, new and updated circuits are continuously needed.

Circuit Designer Duties

Circuit designers are given certain specifications regarding a product or project. These specifications are used as a guideline for designing circuits and circuit boards. Designers are sometimes given conceptual designs that they can turn into real-life, working circuits. Other responsibilities may include designing different types of circuits and boards, such as amplifiers and multi-chip modules (MCM). Additionally, circuit designers create signal processing filters, which extract information from electrical currents and voltages. Circuit designers must work to meet deadlines, achieve quality goals and stay within budgets.

During the design process, circuit designers perform laboratory tests using equipment such as a Network Analyzer, Spectrum Analyzer or Power Meter.

163,https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/robotics-skills/,"Robotics Skills

Although responsibilities in specific roles will vary, there are several universal skills all robotics professionals should have. Individuals with these skills will achieve great success in robotics engineering and have a wide range of careers to choose from.

1. Math and Science
Robotics manufacturer RobotIQ describes mathematics as one of the only core robotics skills that you cannot learn as you go along. At a minimum, a strong background in several fields of mathematics and science are critical for a successful career in robotics:

Algebra and calculus teach you the equations and formulas that represent the abstract concepts that a robot manipulates.
Geometry and physics help you understand a robot’s range of motion in order to minimize movement, reduce wear and tear, and increase the lifespan of the equipment.
Applied mathematics, or the use of math to solve problems in science and engineering, enable you to address challenges such as predicting how a robot will move under certain circumstances.

2. Programming
While a career in robotics requires knowledge of popular programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, there are some key differences between programming for robotics and programming to develop software or mobile applications.

Software applications tend to interact with one another. For example, a website directly requests information from a database, and that database responds with the information the website is requesting. Robots, on the other hand, interact with software, hardware, and various electronics. There are multiple channels to account for when it comes to programming.
RobotIQ points out that many robots are used in an industrial setting, run on proprietary programming languages. This is especially important if you’re working with robots from multiple manufacturers. Therefore, robotics programming is dependent on these multiple languages.
High-level robotic system programming depends on highly complex and technical AI and ML algorithms.

3. Working on a Team
Robotics is largely technical work, but certain soft skills are beneficial, Platt says. In particular, being a team player is essential.

You can also expect the team to follow an Agile project management style, with an iterative process for developing, testing, and getting feedback on a product.

4. Solving Complex Problems
Designing and building functioning technical systems is obviously a critical robotics skill, but it’s just as important to be able to figure out why a system isn’t functioning properly. If it’s a mechanical issue, you’ll need to know the best practices for making a repair. If it’s a software issue, you’ll need to be ready to look for errors or bugs in the code. And if it isn’t immediately clear what the issue is, you’ll need to put your problem-solving skills to work to assess the situation and find a possible solution.

5. Thinking Creatively 
A little bit of creativity can go a long way for a robotics professional. It can be beneficial for solving problems, such as using an existing part in a new way or coming up with a brand-new design altogether. Creativity and teamwork go hand in hand, too—a willingness to work with others and accept their contributions can help the entire team come up with a new idea or different solution.

Creativity can also boost your marketing and business development skills. Computer-assisted design and drafting (CADD) software company Autodesk notes that these are particularly valuable commercial skills for a robotics engineer who has designed a new product. In addition to describing the technical benefits of a product, you’ll need to convince sales staff, marketers, executive leaders, and ultimately customers that your product is worth their time and money. 

6. Active Learning
The field of robotics is always changing. There are new programming languages to learn, new AI concepts to test, and new and more durable materials to work with. A robotics engineer can demonstrate their value by constantly learning about these changes and applying them to new fields of robotics.

Trying to get an accounting job without knowing Microsoft Excel is like trying to become a bus driver without a driver’s license. It’s a basic job requirement. While not all accounting or finance professionals will work in Excel on a daily basis, spreadsheets are standard fare in the field, so it’s still essential to be able to read and analyze the data in them.

At a minimum, accounting and finance candidates should have a solid footing with Excel’s basic features like formulas, sorting and filtering. For roles that will use the platform as part of their primary job duties, candidates should be proficient with advanced features like pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and what-if scenarios.

As the size of an organization grows, so does the volume of data you’ll be dealing with, making these technical skills even more valuable for jobs with enterprise-level organizations.

Knowledge of Quickbooks

Quickbooks is one of the most widely used pieces of accounting software among small businesses, with the online version alone boasting some 4.2 million subscribers. The software offers a suite of financial features that are useful for growing organizations, like expense tracking, invoicing, and payroll.

If you’re going to be working for a small or medium-sized organization or doing business with them, it’s highly likely you’ll be working in Quickbooks, so knowledge of this platform is definitely a technical accounting skill you want on your resume.

Experience with business intelligence software

Accounting and finance professionals do much more than just track money in and money out. They play a crucial role in guiding the financial direction of the organization. This requires the ability to make accurate predictions about what the future holds in terms of sales, inventory and labor, and use that data to make recommendations to the board of directors or c-suite.

Experience with ERP, or enterprise resource planning software, is one of the core skills required for accounting and finance jobs, especially higher-level jobs like senior accountants and financial analysts. You’ll need to use ERP software like SAP and Oracle to plan the purchase of raw materials, control inventory, facilitate distribution, allocate labor hours and more.

Additionally, you might need to work with popular business analytics and reporting software like Tableau or Zoho Analytics. These platforms help organizations take raw data and turn it into visualizations and other meaningful forms of information that can be used to make decisions.

Knowledge of tax preparation software

There’s an entire segment of the accounting and finance industry dedicated to tax. If you work in this part of the field, you’ll obviously need deep knowledge of the software your organization uses for tax preparation.

But even if you don’t work specifically in tax, you’ll likely be keeping records and preparing documents for colleagues who do. So, having a working understanding of the platform your company uses for tax preparation is helpful. Lacerte, ProConnect, and Drake are a few of these commonly used programs.",311,4 Corner Resources
171,https://au.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-accounts-payable,"What is accounts payable in simple words?
Accounts payable are accounts within a business's transaction records that show its responsibility to repay short-term debts. These short-term debts are for goods and services the business receives before paying for them. You may find them recorded as liabilities on a business balance sheet. The amount the account increases or decreases usually appears on the cash flow statement.
This concept might also refer to the business area that makes payments to suppliers and other creditors. There may be a whole dedicated department, for large companies, or something people with more general financial duties handle in smaller businesses.

What is the role of accounts payable?
People working in this profession usually provide financial and administrative support to the business. Their duties can include:
Receiving and checking invoices
Accounts payable receives invoices from the business's creditors, including suppliers and vendors. They check the amount requested on the invoice against their records of unpaid goods and services received. They also note the payment terms and file the invoice until they need to pay. If needed, accounts payable professionals can contact creditors to resolve any concerns in relation to invoices.
Processing payments
Invoices usually state that businesses expect payment within a certain time period, which might be a specific date or time frame. People who work in accounts payable often process payments just before they're due. By delaying payment until the last moment, people in accounts payable might improve their business' cash flow while maintaining good relationships with creditors.
Recording transactions
Accounts payable professionals record their transactions after processing payments. These records note the payment amount and date. Businesses can refer to their records if creditors query their payments. They can also use these records to make predictions about the business's cash flow and future payments.
Producing financial records
Accounts payable professionals help produce financial records to help businesses track cash flow and financial health. Businesses rely on the records people in accounts payable make if their creditors dispute payments made or they're audited. Business executive s might also refer to these financial records when tracking their company's success.
Tracking expenses and income
In many businesses, accounts payable professionals track business expenses and income over set periods of time. They anticipate future payable accounts and income and predict if the businesses have stable cash flow. If they anticipate challenges, they can collaborate with other finance professionals on solutions.
Reviewing records for accuracy
People in accounts payable may check the invoices and financial records carefully to make sure they accurately represent the business's transactions. Reviewing records can help ensure all figures are correct. Typically, this is important for accurate record keeping and financial forecasting.
Managing audits
If the business gets audited, accounts payable professionals may work closely with the Australian Tax Office and people within their business to manage the auditing process. They might answer questions about the business's payment history. They may also give the Australian Tax Office access to their records.

What is the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable?
Accounts payable is the amount a company must pay for its purchased goods and services. Accounts receivable is the amount it gets for goods and services sold. Accounts payable is a business liability, while accounts receivable is an asset.
Accounts receivable professionals have a similar role to accounts payable professionals, but their duties involve the transactions made by the business's customers, rather than their creditors. Accounts receivable professionals track what people owe the business, rather than what it owes others.

Important skills for working in accounts payable
The most successful people working in accounts payable have the following skills:

Analysis
Strong analytical skills help people in accounts payable analyse data in financial documents. Their assessments can help businesses save money and improve cash flow. Analytical skills may also help accounts payable professionals identify errors in financial records.

Computer literacy
Accounts payable professionals use software to track invoices, process payments and manage and produce financial records. Different firms favour different programs, which may change over time with evolving technology. Good computer literacy helps people in accounts payable adjust to these changes and their company's preferred software.

Mathematics
While computer programs make automatic calculations, people working in accounts payable may need strong maths skills. These skills can help them identify errors in records and resolve them for accuracy. Accounts payable professionals might benefit from feeling confident with adding and subtracting.

Organisation
People in accounts payable use their organisation skills to track payments pending and process all invoices on time to maximise cash flow. Their organisation skills also help them keep clear financial records which they can retrieve when they need to. Organisation is a beneficial skill set for people in accounts payable, especially at the end of the financial year and tax time.

Communication
People in accounts payable use their verbal communication skills to speak to creditors, business executives and members of the finance team. These skills help them listen carefully and respond clearly and professionally. Written communication skills also help them create financial reports and liaise with business contacts via email or instant messaging. Strong communication skills also help accounts payable professionals break down financial concepts and explain them in simple terms to people outside the finance sector.",234,Indeed

174,https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/budget-management-skills,"What are budget management skills?

Budget management skills are the abilities and knowledge you use when planning and regulating spending at a business. You can apply these skills in a range of contexts, such as supervising the financial situation of entire businesses to coordinating the spending of a small short-term project. Department heads, team leaders and budget managers use their skills to help businesses maintain and increase profitability. Proper budget management can also allow project managers and supervisors to plan for future expenses and delegate funds appropriately.

Here are some other ways you can apply budget management skills:

Communicating with stakeholders to explain the availability of funds and identify a team's long-term financial situation
Creating charts with budgeting software to display relevant data about spending and income during staff meetings
Conducting financial analyses and reviewing expenses to confirm that the team is using funds appropriately and following the budget

Skills you may apply when managing a budget:

1. Financial analysis
Financial analysis is one of the primary skills used for budget management. It involves gathering data from financial statements to create budget plans and improve budgeting strategies. When reviewing a budget, you use analytical thinking to evaluate a business' financial status and performance. Effective analysis can facilitate growth because a business can use a well-planned budget to hire new employees, make investments or purchase new equipment.

2. Budget auditing
Budget auditing involves reviewing the details of how a budget functions and evaluating its effectiveness and long-term viability. You use auditing skills while collecting data for budget reports and determining any potential misuse of funds. These skills also involve understanding financial compliance rules and regulations so you can compare how your team uses company finances to industry standards. You can apply the results of your audit to make improvements to future budgets and train your team on best practices for recording expenses or purchases with business accounts.

3. Communication
Managing budgets involves communicating budget objectives and plans with stakeholders, executives and colleagues. Budget managers and other professionals use expert communication skills to effectively explain financial trends, budget forecasts and reports in simple terms. This helps coworkers and stakeholders have accurate information about current budget statuses, budget allocation and availability of funds, improving their ability to complete projects according to schedule.

4. Budget reporting
Budget reports are predictions for future financial decisions. Being able to write and format budget reports is a useful skill for anyone who manages money as part of their role. You can use budget reporting skills to determine financial business objectives and compare them to the financial reports at the end of an accounting period. Once you review the reports, you can use the results to help improve budget management for the next accounting period.

5. Forecasting
Forecasting involves creating revenue estimates for the fiscal year based on data from past financial reporting periods and other analytical projections. Budget managers use financial forecasting skills to evaluate business performance, determine how to use funds for investments, allocate money for projects and manage their resources effectively. These skills also help managers identify potential expenses and income streams that can influence the accuracy of their budgeting or create additional risk for their financial planning. Effective forecasting skills can help ensure the budget's proper maintenance throughout a fiscal year.

6. Organization
Because creating and managing a budget requires advanced knowledge of different financial accounts and the ability to track several streams of income, organization is a key skill. Being organized can help you identify the percentage of a budget remaining at any point in an accounting period or make it easy to locate the source of a specific transaction during a budgetary audit. A budget manager uses these skills to monitor and document financial expenses and income. Organizational skills also help them maintain financial documents, create reports and organize financial data.

7. Goal setting
Effective budgeting often involves setting a goal for generating revenue or saving a certain amount of money. Goal-setting skills are valuable for budget management because it helps businesses achieve realistic financial goals. Budget managers use information from financial reports and previous budgets to design revenue estimates and contribute to the goal-setting process. This can help a business maintain a well-balanced budget throughout the fiscal year while still having enough cash flow to support operations.

8. Database management
When managing a budget, you may use databases to record and analyze financial data, create reports and identify patterns or trends. Database management skills allow you to track spending and present expense reports or charts to stakeholders, executives and staff efficiently. They allow you to better oversee a budget, create long-term forecasts and projections, save large data sets and produce visual aids like charts and graphs to summarize your data.

9. Decision making
Budget management involves deciding how to spend money and what to prioritize with your finances. You may use decision-making skills to develop guidelines for spending money during a project, such as how much money to allocate to a department and how it can distribute the funds. Budget managers may also help a business decide how to increase funds, enact budget cuts and determine attainable financial goals.

10. Preparation
It's important for budget managers to have strong preparation skills. Budget preparing involves defining business goals and identifying costs to maintain business operations. A budget manager may use these skills to determine whether a business has the resources to make financial investments that improve different areas of operation. Excellent budget preparation can improve budget management processes and promote accurate financial forecasting and budgeting.

11. Attention to detail
Budget managers use acute attention to detail while gathering and recording financial data. They accurately record the data to develop budget plans, make forecasts and monitor spending. Attention to detail is vital when tracking all expenses to ensure the information in the budget and ledger match the money available in company accounts. Budget managers also use this skill while analyzing financial data and creating reports.

12. Computer skills
Budget managers often have proficient computer skills and knowledge. They may use computer-generated spreadsheets to record expenditures and analyze financial reports. They also use certain budgeting software to streamline processes, such as performing data analysis to form accurate conclusions and apply them to budget plans.

180,https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-costing.html,"What is Costing?

Costing is any system for assigning costs to an element of a business. Costing is typically used to develop costs for customers, distribution channels, employees, geographic regions, products, product lines, processes, subsidiaries, and entire companies.

Costing may involve only the assignment of variable costs, which are those costs that vary with some form of activity (such as sales or the number of employees). This type of costing is called direct costing. For example, the cost of materials varies with the number of units produced, and so is a variable cost.

Costing can also include the assignment of fixed costs, which are those costs that stay the same, irrespective of the level of activity. This type of costing is called absorption costing. Examples of fixed costs are rent, insurance, and property taxes.


Costing is used for internal and external reporting, as described below:

Costing in Internal Reporting

Management uses costing to learn about the cost of operations, so that it can work on refining operations to improve profitability. This information can also be used as the basis for developing product prices.

Costing in External Reporting

The various accounting frameworks require that costs be allocated to the inventory recorded in a company's balance sheet at the end of a reporting period. This calls for the use of a cost allocation system, consistently applied.


Costing Methodologies:

Within the areas of both internal and external reporting, costing is most heavily utilized in the area of assigning costs to products. This can be done with job costing, which requires the detailed assignment of individual costs to production jobs (which are small product batches). Another alternative is to use process costing, where costs are aggregated and charged to a large number of uniform products, such as are found on a production line. An efficiency improvement on either concept is to use standard costing, where costs are estimated in advance and then assigned to products, followed by variance analysis to determine the differences between actual and standard costs.",154,AccountingTools

Proficiency in business development allows financial advisors to create performance objectives and track their sales figures. Advisors may work closely with other members of the organization, such as product suppliers and estate agents. They use business development skills to conduct presentations for management and negotiate prices for products.

Here are examples of skills financial advisors use in their roles:

Research
When a client seeks financial assistance, the advisor conducts extensive research about the client's financial history. They examine how the client's previous money management contributed to their current situation. Advisors also investigate ways to achieve the client's financial goals, which may include making strategic investments in stocks or properties or investing in products, such as life insurance policies or retirement accounts. Research also helps advisors remain informed on new products that emerge on the market.

Wealth management
Financial advisors understand how to achieve and maintain wealth, a skill they use to advise clients on earning and managing their money. Wealth management is an aspect of industry knowledge, where advisors know what investments can generate higher income and their availability on the market. They also know how to identify smart investments based on the funds clients possess and the wealth they want to accumulate.

Analytical thinking
Analytical thinking gives financial advisors the tools to adjust to changing circumstances and devise solutions to problems. For example, a client expresses their financial goal, but they have limited monetary resources to achieve it. Advisors analyze the state of the client's finances and make suggestions that can produce a positive outcome without wasting funds. As new products emerge on the market, advisors practice analytical thinking to decide what products would be most useful for the client to purchase.

Interpersonal communication
Interpersonal communication is an essential client relationship tool, where financial advisors can work with their clients in one-on-one settings and adjust their communication style based on their conversation partner or the occasion. It includes the following sub-categories:
Verbal communication: Advisors explain the findings of their research and their financial guidance in ways their clients can understand. They may use less technical language and deliver their advice in simple terms.

Nonverbal communication: The advisor's body language can show their focus on the session, such as nodding their head and delivering direct eye contact to the client. It may also include maintaining a neutral facial expression as the client explains their needs.
Active listening: Active listening techniques show the client the advisor is paying close attention to their meetings.

Detail orientation
Close attention to detail permits financial advisors to stay organized when completing their occupational duties. They pay attention to the client's requests to gain insight into the investments the client is likely to make. When developing investment strategies, advisors detail their explanations to ensure clients understand what actions to take. Also, advisors remain detail-oriented when recording figures on financial reports.

Empathy
Financial advisors possess empathy to foster meaningful connections with their clients. Clients may be sensitive about the state of their financial resources, and advisors have access to a lot of personal information. With high emotional intelligence, advisors can provide recommendations that cater to the client's needs and lend support.

Risk assessment
It's important for financial advisors to assess and manage risks before they deliver advice to their clients. Risk assessment typically occurs during the research process, where advisors anticipate challenges clients may face as they strive to achieve wealth. Examples of risks might be a fluctuating market, which can influence the success of investments, or lack of job security, which can increase financial stress and possibly limit income for the client in the future.",305,Indeed

194,https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/credit-analyst-skills,"A credit analyst is an in-demand job that requires a strong background in finance, accounting and economics. Many industries require the skills of a credit analyst to evaluate and analyze financial data about the clients' background. The skills required for credit analysis involve the ability to interpret numbers and data, strong observation skills and attention to detail.

A credit analyst is responsible for evaluating business partners and customers to see if they're able to repay loans and generate revenue for the company. Credit analysts recommend a course of action in loan and credit applications. They may also give suggestions to business stakeholders on whether they should make certain investments.
A credit analyst gathers financial information about organizations and individuals, such as valuable properties, income, savings, debts and payment history. They give recommendations on whether it is safe to approve a loan or reduce a credit line. This requires a strong understanding of economics and finance.
Many credit analysts can be mainly found in banking investment, credit card issuers and credit rating agencies. However, the scope of the job of a credit analyst is not limited to the banking industry—they can also work in major businesses that involve investment and finance.

Examples of credit analyst skills

Accounting skills
An accounting background is typically a prerequisite for becoming a credit analyst. A credit analyst normally performs basic accounting techniques such as balancing ledgers, creating financial statements, reviewing statistics and more. It is also important to know the different terminologies used in economics, business and finance.

Knowledge of industry
To make a proper assessment and recommendations, it is important that credit analysts have a background in the industry they work in. Many industries have different requirements and use a variety of methods of investigation. Therefore, a credit analyst must be familiar with the industry they work in to create reliable reports and analyses.

Computing skills
Many businesses use specific financial and accounting programs to process large amounts of data. While many companies provide training in handling various computer programs, having basic knowledge in computing can help learn complicated software.

Communication skills
Part of the responsibilities of a credit analyst involves preparing reports on rating, financial standing and analysis, which requires strong writing skills. Additionally, credit analysts often work with company management and clients to discuss issues and explain certain information. They also normally work in a team that requires constant communication and interaction with other employees.

Problem-solving
Some tasks of credit analysts involve helping clients meet ﻿financial requirements and objectives. This task requires extensive analytical skills, resourcefulness, reliable background in the field and a positive attitude toward finding solutions, all of which are a part of problem-solving. If successful in helping clients, analysts can form long-lasting relationships. Having the skill to solve difficult situations is also helpful in reducing risks in businesses.

Attention to detail
Credit analysts regularly handle various information such as financial data, personal background of clients and more. The information that credit analysts handle is sensitive and crucial to the business, which is why one of the most important skills that recruiters look for in a credit analyst is the ability to pay attention to details.

Documentation and organization skills
In most cases, credit analysts are required to keep updated records of clients' information. They need to keep all of their documents organized so they can provide information quickly to managers or clients as soon as they need it. Organization also helps them ensure they comply with any regulations or guidelines in their industry.

Knowledge in risk analysis
Knowledge in risk analysis helps a credit analyst foresee all possible challenges when handling financial data and making reports and recommendations. A credit analyst should be able to give a thorough explanation of why a loan or investment should be approved so managers and business owners have a clear idea of the risks involved. This helps owners avoid unnecessary risks and increase their capital.

Investigative skills
Another common task of a credit analyst is to question clients to gather more information and verify the truthfulness of their answers. A credit analyst often manages large amounts of information to make a reasonable judgment with their recommendations. For example, a credit analyst in the real estate industry collects evidence through background investigation and supporting documents to ensure clients can pay a loan in a reasonable amount of time.

Quantitative analysis skills
The day-to-day tasks of a credit analyst revolve mainly on analyzing figures from the client's regular income to statistical data. These tasks require advanced math and the ability to interpret quantitative data.",441,Indeed

1. Excellent Communication to Increase Loan Originations
Written and verbal communication is critical for loan officers and customer satisfaction. Responsible for selling loans to clients, loan officers or originators need to be able to clearly communicate loan structures, details, payment plans, and more to homeowners. Through excellent communication, borrowers will feel more confident in the lending institution and feel as though they are taken care of. Without great communication, borrowers or homeowners may start to feel as though the lender is unresponsive or hard to work with—an impression you don’t want to leave with customers.
2. Ability to Negotiate More Profitable Mortgages
As the main communicator with borrowers, loan officers also need to have great negotiation skills. Because the mortgage amount or structure is subject to change based on a borrower’s risk and credit, a great loan officer needs to be able to negotiate those changes with them. This helps ensure that borrowers won’t go to other lending institutions looking for a mortgage, and instead will be convinced to stay under new mortgage terms. And perhaps more importantly, the loan officer needs to convince homeowners that the mortgage is still a good deal that they can’t find elsewhere, increasing their satisfaction levels.

Mortgage Loan Processor Skills

3. Great Organizational Skills for Maintaining Accurate Records
The loan processor is the member of the mortgage team that files mortgages with the correct government entity. To do this, loan processors need to be highly organized to ensure that mortgage documents are filed with the correct parties. Missing this step could result in penalties for the institution, making organization a must-have skill for processors in order to protect the company.
4. Great Proofreading Skills to Catch Mortgage Errors
Another job duty for loan processors is to proofread each mortgage that comes across their desk. Being able to quickly spot errors, typos, or miscalculations is what makes a loan processor a true asset to the team. If a loan were to pass through to underwriting with errors, it’s possible the error may never be caught and it could affect the mortgage’s profitability—something no institution wants.

199,https://gradaustralia.com.au/career-planning/which-accountancy-specialisation-is-right-for-me,"Here’s a rundown of the main areas of specialisation in accountancy and the type of person they will most likely appeal to:

1) Assurance
This is fertile ground for those with a strong academic record, above-average communication skills and plentiful self-confidence. CPA defines assurance as professional services that are 'intended to increase the confidence that users can place in a given subject matter or information'. It involves reviewing the financial data and procedures of a company to ensure decisions are being made based on quality information and shareholders’ money is being put to proper use. You’ll also be providing potential investors with the information they need to determine whether to put money into a company. Expect to be involved in e-commerce, mergers and acquisitions, internal controls, inventories, fixed assets, accounts payable and system reliability (basically anywhere information needs to be compiled to make a smart business decision).

2) Commercial finance
Got good business awareness and strong analytical skills? Commercial finance is at the heart of industry and focuses on consumer transactions. You could be employed anywhere from retail, to manufacturing, to fast-moving consumer goods or the leisure sector. You’ll be expected to analyse the performance of your employer’s products or services and make profit-maximising recommendations.

3) Corporate finance
You’ll need unshakeable confidence, unimpeachable communication and numeracy skills and an appetite for long hours and high-stakes situations. You’ll mainly be adding value to businesses in the midst of M&A activity, sourcing funds, and capital restructures. Roles range from lead advisers, who project manage the process of raising capital, through to reporting accountants and auditors, who are responsible for making sure the accounts of target companies are in good order. Whatever the role, you’ll be playing a crucial part in assessing and managing risk from strategic, tactical, and financial perspectives.

4) Corporate treasury
Have a masterly grasp of business and economics, top-shelf analytical skills and a knack for working well when the heat is on? Corporate treasurers play a crucial role in any organisation given it’s their responsibility to make sure there’s enough cash on hand to cover outgoings. This chiefly involves monitoring liquidity in the company’s finances. You’ll also need to be across any developments in the business that generate risk and to have arranged the necessary capital to keep the organisation solvent should a risky initiative go bad.  

5) Financial accounting
This is a smart choice for those with an analytical, inquiring mind, top-notch communication skills and a willingness to challenge an organisation to improve the way it works. Financial accountants analyse and report on financial transactions (via financial statements like the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement), which helps yield vital data on a business’s performance.
The difference between financial and management accounting is that financial accountants provide reports for people outside the organization (e.g. investors, regulatory bodies etc), where management accountants provide reporting to help managers within the organization make decisions. As a financial accountant, you’ll sometimes need to explain complex financial situations to non-experts, so the ability to communicate well is important.

6) Forensic accounting
If you love a good detective story, you may wish to consider becoming a forensic accountant and help clients with problems such as fraud, disputes and suspected misconduct. You’ll carry out investigations to uncover key information about the person or organisation in question and quantify the losses involved. You’ll need an inquisitive mind as well as the communication skills to explain complex problems to non-experts. One added bonus: thanks to the recently released Ben Affleck action film (The Accountant), forensic accountants are enjoying a moment of pop culture sexiness!

7) Insolvency
This is a specialisation best suited to those with an insatiable curiosity about the way different companies work, strong negotiation skills, a capacity to process complex financial information and a dash of sensitivity. You’ll have the weighty responsibility of doing what you can to ensure that creditors, suppliers or employees of failing businesses get the best outcome possible. Specialists in this field are usually appointed through referrals from banks, lawyers and accountants so you’ll also need good relationship-building skills.

8) Internal audit
This isn’t too far removed from being a forensic accountant, though you’ll be a lot closer to those you’re being paid to keep an eye on. As the name suggests, internal auditors examine key areas of the business they’re employed by and report their findings to management. Essentially, it will be your job to warn management if any divisions are being run in an inefficient, financially risky or fraudulent way. It’s a delicate job best suited to those with both an eye for detail and the ability to grasp the bigger picture. Internal auditors also need a thorough knowledge of how businesses are run and an ability to communicate effectively, often in tense circumstances.

9) Management accounting
You’ll require sharp decision-making skills, plenty of business acumen and the ability to convey complex financial information to staff at various levels in an accessible manner. Management accounting is all about the supply of information and reports that can aid in the decision-making processes in a company. Management accountants gain an in-depth knowledge of the sectors they work in and a range of skills such as planning, management and strategy (in addition to the standard accounting competencies). Once they’ve acquired this skill set, knowledge and experience, management accountants can proffer valuable, specialised, business-specific guidance.

10) Risk assessment
Do you have a questioning, logical mindset that zeroes in on problems? The creativity to come up with solutions to those problems? Interpersonal skills and confidence? If so, risk assessment could be for you. It’s all about helping organisations understand, prioritise and manage risk to avoid problems and capitalise on opportunities. This enables clients to reach their goals, which might include growing their business, outperforming competition or protecting their brand.

11) Tax
For obvious reasons, this is a speciality with plenty of opportunities for advancement and potentially hefty remuneration. To stand out from the competition, you’ll need a talent for analysis and problem solving, first-rate numeracy skills and the ability to create and maintain trusting working relationships. Needless to say, discretion is also a must. Tax advisers may be temporarily engaged by businesses or wealthy individuals as consultants to offer one-off solutions to a particular tax problem. Alternatively, they may be employed on an ongoing basis, ensuring compliance and cost-effective solutions to taxation demands made on their client.",60,Gradaustralia

A tax role has two main parts: compliance and consultancy:

1. Compliance
Compliance is the nitty-gritty of tax – the paperwork. One key compliance job is to complete your client’s tax return according to the current regulations and file it on time. Depending on your specialism, you might do calculations, accounting and paperwork for things like setting up family trusts or estate planning. At the beginning of your career, you can expect to focus on compliance while you learn the ropes.

2. Consultancy
Consultancy is the problem-solving side of the tax business. Tax advisors make sure their clients’ finances are tax-efficient (simply put, they find ways for their clients to pay the minimum tax possible). It means knowing tax regulations inside out and being able to take advantage of all the available tax structures, tax breaks and loopholes. This is what you’ll focus on as a qualified tax advisor.


There are three main tax areas:

1. Corporate tax – managing tax for companies or corporations. There are specialisms within this, such as transfer pricing.
2. Personal tax – managing tax for individuals. Specialisms include estate planning and high net worth individuals.
3. Indirect tax – managing tax on goods and services, such as VAT on products. This is different from tax on personal income or company profits.


On an average day at the office, you might do some of these things:

Work on or check over a tax return for a client
Review a change in tax legislation and report back to your colleagues
Collate information on a client’s tax position to prepare for a meeting

What types of firms can you work for?

1. Accountancy firms
These firms usually offer their clients full accountancy services, including audit, risk management and corporate finance. They range from medium to large. The largest are the Big Four (Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC) which also offer a range of consultancy services. 

2. Tax advice firms
Often boutique and specialist, these focus on tax. They may cater to companies or individuals.

3. In-house
Some companies have in-house tax professionals to handle their own taxes. Depending on the company’s size, the tax department could be one person, twenty or hundreds.


Skills:

1. Communication
When you work in Tax, you need to explain complex regulations in a way non-specialists can understand. Clear written and verbal communication is an absolute must.

2. Numeracy
You don’t need to be a maths genius - plenty of humanities students get into Tax. But you do need to be comfortable with numbers.

3. Time management
To be successful, you’ll need to prioritise tasks, meet deadlines and take personal responsibility for a professional workload.

4. Commercial awareness
Organisations want their employees to be honestly enthusiastic about their jobs. Commercial awareness shows you’re interested in your industry and you'll be able to keep up with changes as you work.

5. Problem-solving skills
In Tax, you often need to get creative. For example, if you want to reduce the tax a client pays there are a huge range of tools you could recommend, such as trusts and tax-free investments.

6. Attention to detail
In tax law, the regulations say exactly what they mean – and you need to interpret them exactly that way. That means paying attention to every word.

7. Organisation
You’ll be facing large, complex tasks during your career in Tax. You need to be able to break them down into sections you can tackle methodically.",296,Bright Network

They also need to be tech-savvy, because they often have to update patient charts through a hospital’s online database.
Nurses also need some soft skills. They have to be patient and empathetic towards both patients and patients’ families.

Examples of Nursing Skills

Communication Skills
Nurses must have excellent communication skills because so much of what they do involves transmitting information, from instructing and educating patients to briefing doctors and other nurses on changes in a patient’s status. Discussions can be complicated by the fact that many patients know little about medicine, so health information must be translated into less technical terms.

Communicating compassion, respect, and confidence to patients and families who may be frightened or angry are critical. Nurses also have to listen carefully to patients and families to collect important information.

Critical Thinking Skills
Healthcare involves solving puzzles. While most nurses are not responsible for diagnosis or deciding on the course of care, they still must respond correctly to emerging situations, and their input is often invaluable. Some of these decisions are obvious, based on established standards of care, but others are not.

Kindness
Not all patients are pleasant and polite. Some can be abusive or ungrateful. All deserve compassionate care. The ability to be kind and considerate to someone who is misbehaving, even in the face of one’s discomfort and exhaustion, is critical in nursing.

Observational Skills
Small, subtle changes, such as a strange odor to the breath or a detail of a patient’s lifestyle shared in casual conversation, could be very important diagnostic signs. While nurses are not typically responsible for diagnosis, the doctor might not be present when the change happens, or when the patient shares the information. Nurses have to notice these details and recognize them as important.

Physical Endurance
Nurses often have to move heavy equipment and even patients, and they work very long hours. Physical strength and endurance are very important. Nurses who are not in good condition themselves are liable to develop health problems of their own, requiring care, rather than giving it.

The quality of medical documentation has several far-reaching impacts, from directly affecting the quality of patient care, to influencing hospital funding.

There are three fundamental reasons to keep in mind when striving for excellent documentation:
1. It’s a form of communication
Good documentation promotes continuity of care through clear communication between all members involved in patient care. The medical record is a way to communicate treatment plans to other providers regarding your patient. This ultimately ensures the highest quality of patient care. Conversely, poor records can have negative impacts on clinical decision-making and the delivery of care.
2. It’s a legal document
A medical record is a legal document. In the case of any legal proceedings, documentation is heavily scrutinised to help support an argument either way. Documenting sensitive discussions regarding limits of care, prognosis, and treatment decisions clearly and transparently is crucial.
3. It’s a document of service

They collect and analyze data to uncover and prosecute electronic fraud, scams, and identity theft. The abundance of digital data helps them solve crimes in the physical world as well. Computer forensics technicians must adhere to the same strict standards of evidence gathering found in general forensic science because legal cases depend on the integrity of evidence.

All forensic science technicians prepare written reports that detail their findings and investigative methods. They must be able to explain their reports to lawyers, detectives, and other law enforcement officials. In addition, forensic science technicians may be called to testify in court about their findings and methods.

Forensic science technicians should also possess the following specific qualities:

Communication skills. Forensic science technicians write reports and testify in court. They often work with other law enforcement and specialists.

Composure. Crime scenes are often the results of acts of violence and destruction, but technicians have to maintain their professionalism and objectivity.

Critical-thinking skills. Forensic science technicians use their best judgment when matching physical evidence, such as fingerprints and DNA, to suspects.

Detail oriented. Forensic science technicians must be able to notice small changes in mundane objects to be good at collecting and analyzing evidence.

Math and science skills. Forensic science technicians need a solid understanding of statistics and natural sciences to be able to analyze crime scene evidence.

Problem-solving skills. Forensic science technicians use scientific tests and methods to help law enforcement officials solve crimes.",485,Truity

Their duties include coordinating with company management to identify potential risks, implementing policies and procedures to uphold laws and regulations and monitoring the company’s adherence to those policies and procedures.

Compliance Officer Duties and Responsibilities

The daily duties and responsibilities of a Compliance Officer generally revolve around identifying and eliminating the risks of noncompliance, both externally and internally. Your job description should accurately describe the specific rules and regulations that the Compliance Officers must constantly monitor.

Their most important duties and responsibilities are:

Develop internal company policies and see that they are respected.
Make sure the organization has a clearly defined program for complying with the country’s laws.
Constantly report to management concerning the organization’s compliance with laws and regulations.
Take action in dealing with noncompliance situations, creating realistic plans to overcome them.
Conduct regular audits to identify potential weaknesses and noncompliance situations.
Communicate with employees and make sure everyone is aware of what they need to do to comply with internal and external laws and regulations.

What Does a Compliance Officer Do?

Compliance Officers typically work for corporations across industries to protect their credibility by maintaining safe and ethical business practices. They review financial statements, operating procedures and employee feedback to determine whether a company maintains legal operations. Their job is to identify areas of noncompliance and coordinate with management and employees to develop improvement plans. They may also visit departments or company branches to perform random internal audits to ensure compliance with laws and regulations at all levels of the company.

The most important skills for a compliance officer are:

Risk assessment skills are crucial for a successful compliance officer as a large part of their work duties are identifying noncompliance risks.
Communication skills ensure that the compliance officer can successfully communicate their findings, ideas and plans to both management and employees.
Attention to detail is needed to spot certain aspects of rules and regulations that can easily be overlooked.
Moral integrity is important because the compliance officer typically needs to understand and promote the importance of complying with rules and regulations.
Problem-solving skills are necessary because many compliance issues have no straightforward solution and compliance officers need to find ways of complying with rules and regulations without negatively affecting the company’s operations.

What are the daily duties of a Compliance Officer?

On a typical day, a Compliance Officer starts by checking their email and voicemail to respond to time-sensitive messages from upper management. They also use this time to review their schedule for meeting times. Throughout the day, they participate in meetings with company Executives to go over new employment laws, transportation and manufacturing standards and other types of government regulations. Compliance Officers use the time between meetings to visit with department Managers and obtain financial statements and other documents to review.
During downtime in their office, Compliance Officers review these documents and compare them to current legislation. They make a note of any troubling activity to report to upper management. Compliance Officers also draft reports or memos to help employees understand how to comply with laws and regulations.

What qualities make a good Compliance Officer?

A good Compliance Officer has a strong ethical code that motivates them to identify instances of fraud, safety issues or environmental concerns and report them accordingly. They have excellent verbal communication, which allows them to speak with company executives, employees and external professionals. They also have excellent written communication skills to write reports and policy documents that enforce laws and regulations within the company. Further, a good Compliance Officer regularly reviews state and federal news to identify new rules that apply to their company and its industry.

ECM has rapidly evolved as different forms of content have been introduced to the work environment. However, these tools continue to focus on digitally managing a company's information in a centralized repository and using the digital content to support business processes and help achieve goals.


ECM software

ECM software provides several capabilities, but companies that want more flexibility in choosing content management tools or don't need all of the components of an ECM suite can purchase one-off applications from software providers to meet their needs. This approach to managing enterprise content -- which includes content services applications, platforms and components -- falls into the content services classification Gartner created in 2016.

At a high level, key elements of ECM incorporate the following:

content lifecycle management
workflow management
information governance
content management systems
collaboration tools
enterprise document management
digital asset management

Robust ECM software includes these features:

Automated workflows. A workflow engine pushes content through a set of defined steps that support business processes and the content lifecycle.
Integration with other applications. It’s useful for ECM to interoperate with an organization’s existing platforms, such as CRM and ERP applications. Many ECM platforms use RESTful APIs to integrate with other web services. Generally, cloud-based ECM tools easily integrate with other cloud services.
Disaster recovery planning. ECM software incorporates disaster recovery planning, allowing organizations to digitally secure and protect their content from theft, fire or natural disaster, while also ensuring that operations proceed as normal in the case of a disaster.
Document scanning. ECM software enables users to easily convert paper-based documents into digital information, store those documents in the ECM system, and share, manage and mine them with efficiency.
Search capabilities. One of the primary goals of ECM is to make content more accessible to users. Advanced search capabilities should be a top priority, enabling users to perform a full-text search and filter the results.
Metadata support. Advanced ECM platforms include support for automated metadata and tagging driven by an AI engine. They also support multiple enterprise taxonomies.
Versioning. ECM can track and store multiple versions of files. These tools may also incorporate the ability to revert to a previous version of a document.
User access controls. For security reasons, an ECM platform often has capabilities to prevent unauthorized users from viewing or editing certain documents. Many ECM platforms incorporate role-based access controls to achieve this.

Mobile User Interface Design
Cross-Platform App Development
Backend Computing
Modern Language Programming Skills
Business Capability

Part 1. Skill Required For Native App Development:
Let’s start with what you need to know to create native apps. In case you’re not familiar with the term yet, these applications are marked by the best performance and UX possible. They’re written in native programming languages and have no limits on the kinds of features or integrations you can implement.

Learn Kotlin, Android SDK & Android Studio

If you’re aiming to create apps for Android, Kotlin is the programming language you need to master. (It replaced Java in 2019 because it’s more concise than its predecessor.) It’s designed to be interoperable with Java, so if you already know Java, learning Kotlin will be a piece of cake.

Android SDK (software development kit) will be your main toolbox when you write code. So, you need to know your way around its debugger, libraries, documentation, and emulator.

Android Studio is the integrated development environment (IDE) that you’ll be using the most. While you’re mastering it, pay special attention to the layout editor, template-based wizard, and quick fixes.

Learn Swift, iOS SDK & Xcode

Swift is Kotlin’s counterpart for native iOS app development, and their histories are quite similar. Like Kotlin, Swift also replaced Objective-C as the main programming language for iOS devices. The reasoning was the same: Objective-C remained unchanged since the 1980s.

As for the SDK and IDE, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise here: you can’t use them on Microsoft Windows computers; they’re available only on macOS. So, if you want to create iOS apps, you’ll have to have a Macintosh.

Part 2. Skills required for Cross Platform App Development:
Native apps have their drawbacks: you can’t reuse any of the code of your iOS product for creating the same application for Android. That’s why cross-platform technologies are in such high demand. With special tools, you can write the codebase for both apps in one language, cutting the development time and costs in half.

Xamarin (C#)

Backed by Microsoft, Xamarin is a free open-source platform that allows developers to write the codebase with C# and the .NET framework for three target platforms: Windows, Android, and iOS. That codebase gets connected to native components via so-called bridges.

As you probably have already guessed, if you want to use Xamarin in your development, you’ll need to master C# and the .NET framework first. Those are the only two prerequisites, however.

React Native (JavaScript)

Developed by Meta (formerly known as Facebook), this JavaScript framework is made to bring together the best of two worlds. In a nutshell, if you want to create a cross-platform app with React Native, you’ll have to write the code in JavaScript – and it’ll get compiled into either Kotlin or Swift.

To master React Native, you should start with learning the ropes of JavaScript first. Once you have a firm grasp of the JavaScript basics, make sure to get to know React, a JavaScript library that is the basis of React Native.

Part 3. Some More Essential Skills for Any Mobile Developer:
Being a mobile app developer isn’t just about writing the code, much like being a blogger isn’t just about writing posts. Apart from coding, you’ll also need to collaborate with other developers, improve the codebase, write documentation, and more. Here are seven skills you’ll need for that.

Using Git Software

This is the standard tool that development teams use to collaborate on any project. So, knowing how to work with repositories, code reviews, pull requests, and merging is a must for you. You can start with GitHub, it’s the most commonly used Git tool out there.

UI & UX Design Basics

The apps you create have to be user-friendly, period. So, even if you spend your days writing code in the IDE, you still have to understand the key principles of usability and user experience to succeed at your job. You should also look into user personas, user interviews, and key metrics.

Cybersecurity Basics

Whenever you write code, you have to assume someone is going to try to find exploits in it and use them. So, you have to be aware of the basics of cybersecurity – and how to apply them when it comes to a particular language, library, or framework.

Writing Clean Code

If you don’t do this, maintaining and updating it is going to be hell for anyone who isn’t you. In a nutshell, writing clean code means naming variables properly, avoiding disinformation, being consistent, keeping your functions small and single-purpose, among other things.

Testing & Debugging

No one can write a perfect piece of software on the first try. What matters is how you pin down the errors in the code and fix them. And to do that, you need to be aware of different types of testing, how to use the right tools, and what to do with bugs.

Writing Documentation

When you’re a beginner in the world of coding, you might not think about commenting at all. But every line of your code has to be documented well for anyone who will work on it in the future. That means leaving comments that explain what purpose every function, variable, or class serves.

Agile Methodology Principles

The majority of development companies build their day-to-day operations on this methodology, so you have to know what it means in practice. In other words, get educated on its core values, iterations and increments, feedback loops, etc.

Part 4. Soft Skills:

Communication and interpersonal skills;
Collaboration and teamwork;
Problem-solving;
Analytical mindset;
Thinking outside the box.

Network File System (NFS) is a networking protocol for distributed file sharing. A file system defines the way data in the form of files is stored and retrieved from storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives and tape drives. NFS is a network file sharing protocol that defines the way files are stored and retrieved from storage devices across networks.

The NFS protocol defines a network file system, originally developed for local file sharing among Unix systems and released by Sun Microsystems.

NFS enables system administrators to share all or a portion of a file system on a networked server to make it accessible to remote computer users. Clients with authorization to access the shared file system can mount NFS shares, also known as shared file systems. NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to route requests between clients and servers.

NFS is one of the most widely used protocols for file servers. NFS implementations are available for most modern operating systems (OSes), including the following:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise HP-UX
IBM AIX
Microsoft Windows
Linux
Oracle Solaris
Cloud vendors also implement the NFS protocol for cloud storage, including Amazon Elastic File System, NFS file shares in Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Filestore.

Any device that can be attached to an NFS host file system can be shared through NFS. This includes hard disks, solid state drives, tape drives, printers and other peripherals. Users with appropriate permissions can access resources from their client machines as if those resources are mounted locally.

NFS is an application layer protocol, meaning that it can operate over any transport or network protocol stack. However, in most cases NFS is implemented on systems running the TCP/IP protocol suite. The original intention for NFS was to create a simple and stateless protocol for distributed file system sharing.

A system administrator is responsible for maintaining the entire IT infrastructure of an organization. Their work ranges from maintaining servers to updating software and everything else in between. They are the first point-of-contact for any technical problems that employees face.

Here are the four types of system administrators based on their roles and responsibilities:

Network Administrators

Network administrators manage the entire network infrastructure of an organization. They design and install computer systems, routers, switches, local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), and intranet systems. They also monitor the systems, provide maintenance and troubleshoot any problems when they arise.

Database Administrators

Database administrators (DBA) set up and maintain databases used in an organization. They may also be required to integrate data from an old database into a new one or even create a database from scratch. In large organizations, there are specialized DBAs who are only responsible for managing databases. In smaller organizations, the roles of DBAs and server administrators can overlap.

Server/Web Administrators

Server or web administrators specialize in maintaining servers, web services and operating systems of the servers. They monitor the speed of the internet to make sure that everything runs smoothly. They also analyze a website’s traffic patterns and implement changes based on user feedback. 

Security Systems Administrators

Security systems administrators monitor and maintain the security systems of an organization. They develop organizational security procedures and also run regular data checkups - setting up, deleting and maintaining user accounts.

In large organizations, all these roles may all be separate positions within one department. In smaller organizations, they may be shared by a few system administrators, or even one single person.

System Administrator - Skills

Since maintaining an entire IT infrastructure is not an easy feat, system administrators need to have a mixture of hard and soft skills. Here are a few skills that companies look for in system administrators.

Knowledge of different operating systems (Microsoft, Unix, Linux, etc.)
Basic programming skills - (PHP, JavaScript, etc.)
Hardware knowledge
Attention to detail
Problem solving mindset
Critical thinking
The most important skill for a system administrator is the ability to solve problems under pressure. Since every minute is critical for the success of a business, a system administrator  should be able to quickly diagnose what is wrong and how best to fix it.

Here are some common requirements that you would find in a system administrator job description:

Install and configure software, hardware and networks
Ensure security and efficiency of IT infrastructure
Monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues 
Identify system requirements and install upgrades 
Maintains, secure and upgrade a web system

403,https://www.netsuite.com.au/portal/au/resource/articles/erp/supply-chain-planning-scp.shtml,"A product requires supply chain planning at every phase of its life cycle. Steps include:

Demand planning and management: Accurately forecasting demand for a product improves your chances of producing and stocking adequate inventory to meet customer needs on a timely basis, without having to store surpluses. Supply chain planners look at historical customer behaviour, projected versus actual sales, market conditions and other factors. Increasingly, they use predictive analytics to better understand the demand for a particular product—how much, where and when it should arrive. Then, supply chain planners estimate the internal demands on each link in their supply chains.

Supply management: Supply management involves sourcing and procuring trusted sources of raw materials, components, software and other goods that go into making your product or service.

Production management: In parallel, capacity planning addresses your own company’s production lines in terms of machinery, staff and efficiency. The key question: How much can we realistically produce during the planning period? Keep in mind that this could be less than your demand forecast.

Inventory management: How a company orders, handles and stores goods can significantly impact costs, operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Companies aim to manage inventory levels with supply chain partners to keep stock on hand at an optimal level while ensuring reliable customer service.

Inventory management can also provide other financial advantages, such as the ability to capitalise on volume prices from suppliers and accurately include the value of inventory in assets listed in company balance sheets and tax filings. More sophisticated inventory management systems can identify high- and low-performing products and trigger reorders when stock dwindles.

Pricing strategy: Setting an optimal price is part art, part science. Honing an effective strategy is critical, however, to manage the balance between supply and demand. For example, price cuts can stimulate sales during periods of low demand, helping you cover the fixed costs of production lines and your workforce.

Event management: This involves identifying all possible supply chain bottlenecks, breakdowns and delays at every link in the chain and developing contingency plans, such as workarounds, buffers and backups.

Integrated business planning (IBP): This is an approach that links your supply chain planning with the rest of your business, from sales and operations through finance. Because IBP gathers information from across the enterprise, it also can help companies perform better predictive analysis to grow the business and manage risk.

Here are seven basic principles that leading supply chain planners adopt:

Synchronise supply chain planning and execution, how often you update your data and planning horizons—or how far into the future your company will project.
Systematically manage data so that you can use consistent information throughout your supply chain planning and management processes. This includes data about items, customers, manufacturing resources and suppliers.
Build cooperative relationships with suppliers and primary customers so you can more easily adjust forecasts, orders and increase sales.
Examine the data used in your demand planning for flaws, such as forecast errors or bias.
Focus on actual point-of-sale data more than your company’s sales orders.
Continuously analyse the product lifecycle, looking for ways to improve the links between product development and the supply chain.
Create a culture of steady improvement to better understand customer behaviour.",392,Oracle Netsuite

407,https://www.careeraddict.com/top-10-skills-needed-for-a-job-in-advertising,"So, apart from having a great work ethic, thick skin and being social media savvy, what other key skills do you need to have to work in this exciting industry? 

1. Creativity
Having bags of creativity and being equipped with an endless array of ideas that you can pick from your brain during an intense brainstorming session is essential, especially when working in a field that involves creating eye-catching content to sell a brand or a product. 
Having a creative personality and imaginative ideas will allow you to create content that can grab the comsumers’ attention in an often-oversaturated market. 

2. Teamwork
Creating a successful advertising campaign takes a team of talented professionals, so having the ability to work as part of a team is crucial. 
Account managers, creatives and marketing executives will be required to routinely put their heads together and develop imaginative content while also ensuring that the client’s needs are being met. 
The collaborative effort of those involved in a project will ultimately determine its success. Having the ability to take criticism (even when you think your idea is amazing) and incorporate other peoples’ ideas into your own vision is part and parcel of working as part of a team of creatives.

3. Communication skills
Effective communication skills are essential, especially when you are pitching an idea to your team. 
However, being a good communicator is not just vital for internal team dialogues. You will also find yourself having regular discussions with clients, which will involve lots of back-and-forth and frequent correspondences. So, knowing how to communicate effectively and professionally is crucial. 
Whether you’re having a discussion with your team or presenting a project to a client, having the ability to convey information clearly is crucial, especially in an industry that is all about selling yourself and your pitch.

4. Active listening
While communication skills are indeed important, the ability to actively listen is also crucial. Working in the field of advertisement will regularly bring you in contact with various people, including your colleagues and clients, who will relay project details or pitch their ideas to you. 
As an advertiser, you cannot afford to ignore or misinterpret your clients or co-workers, especially when details are essential to the successful completion of a project.

5. Computer skills
Having adequate computer skills is obligatory in an industry that is fast becoming focused solely on digital marketing. Depending on your role, most of your day-to-day operations will involve working from your computer while using software like Photoshop and Illustrator. Or you may find yourself simply responding to client emails while relaying project specifications. 
Either way, being able to work with technology is pivotal. Having experience working with software and tools used by advertising agencies to strategise and manage their projects is also important!

6. Social media skills
Being social media savvy will help you stay in the loop with the latest online trends and developments. Considering that the modern consumer mostly digests content through social media platforms and is determined by what pops up on their newsfeed, having a good grasp of these different apps and tools will boost your work performance. 

7. Commercial awareness
While we have already covered the need to be aware of the different social media trends and platforms, being commercially aware encapsulates a lot more than just knowing how to send a tweet. 
Understanding the market and being at the forefront of consumers’ wants and needs is essential in fulfilling clients’ business requirements and project specifications. 
Having commercial awareness while working in the advertisement field involves:
Doing comprehensive market and product research
Reading trade and retail publications
Keeping an eye on the financial market.

8. Research skills
Speaking of research, having the ability to comb through numerous sources to find inspiration will prove quite useful to you. 
Research skills require both concentration and commitment to the process as you steadily flick through a catalogue of case studies, academic research reports and previous advertising campaigns. This will prove to be beneficial when you are cultivating your next great idea for a major client.

9. Multitasking skills
Working in advertising often means having to wear many different hats. Being able to actively balance budgets while interpreting complex information are just some of the tasks you will be expected to do while managing a project. 
Working on different projects can be complex and quite demanding, as they involve an array of tasks such as market research, metrics coordination, product testing and client feedback. 
Knowing how to balance these tasks without compromising on the finer details will be key in ensuring success.

10. Marketing skills
Do you know how to plan, design, and present compelling advertising campaigns to the public? These are just some of the performance indicators that you will measure when creating and implementing an advertising campaign. 
Marketing is essentially the overall strategy for promoting a brand, product or service, so having a good understanding of different marketing techniques and strategies is vital for any professional in the advertisement industry.

11. Organisational skills
As you may have already guessed, being an organised individual is a must for working in the advertisement sector, and for a good reason. A day in the life of an advertiser can be quite hectic, and being able to keep to tight deadlines while managing multiple appointments with clients and colleagues requires extraordinary organisation skills. 

12. Adaptability
In a continuously evolving market, having the willingness and ability to learn and try new things is imperative. 
Advertisers must continuously evolve with technology to reach new audiences. Being able to adapt to these changes will help you stay on top.

Qualitative research is concerned with human behaviour, and why people act the way that they do.

Common methods used for qualitative research include Interviews and Focus Groups and Group Interviews. Both these methods allow researchers to explore a topic in depth with one or two people at a time, or within a small group. You can also collect Qualitative Data from Interactions, in research that recognises that the researcher is a key part of the situation, rather than an outside observer.


Quantitative Research Designs
Quantitative research always collects numerical data.

If you are not collecting numbers, then your research is qualitative, not quantitative. Quantitative research is usually used to get views from large numbers of people.

The first step in quantitative research is to determine your Sampling and Sample Design. You then need to gather data. Suitable methods include surveys (and our page on Surveys and Survey Design explains more about this surprisingly complex subject).

Other sources of data include Observational and Secondary Data.


Analysing Research Data
Your choice of analysis method will depend heavily on your choice of research method.

For example, for qualitative research, you may need an approach like content analysis, because you will have generated large amounts of data, often narrative in form. Our page on Analysing Qualitative Data explains more.
